	ABSTRACT = {Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of Salmonella supports both molecular typing and detection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Here, we evaluated the correlation between phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) and in silico prediction of AMR from WGS in Salmonella enterica (n = 1321) isolated from human infections in Canada. Phenotypic AMR results from broth microdilution testing were used as the gold standard. To facilitate high-throughput prediction of AMR from genome assemblies, we created a tool called Staramr, which incorporates the ResFinder and PointFinder databases and a custom gene-drug key for antibiogram prediction. Overall, there was 99% concordance between phenotypic and genotypic detection of categorical resistance for 14 antimicrobials in 1321 isolates (18,305 of 18,494 results in agreement). We observed an average sensitivity of 91.2% (range 80.5&ndash;100%), a specificity of 99.7% (98.6&ndash;100%), a positive predictive value of 95.4% (68.2&ndash;100%), and a negative predictive value of 99.1% (95.6&ndash;100%). The positive predictive value of gentamicin was 68%, due to seven isolates that carried aac(3)-IVa, which conferred MICs just below the breakpoint of resistance. Genetic mechanisms of resistance in these 1321 isolates included 64 unique acquired alleles and mutations in three chromosomal genes. In general, in silico prediction of AMR in Salmonella was reliable compared to the gold standard of broth microdilution. WGS can provide higher-resolution data on the epidemiology of resistance mechanisms and the emergence of new resistance alleles.},
